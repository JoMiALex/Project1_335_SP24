\* Contains Algorithm 1's & 2's:
    Pseudocode, Mathematical Analysis, How It Works
\*

## Algorithm 1
### Pseudocode


###  Complexity and Efficiency Class
    Proof by Step Count:
    T(n) = 
        Therefore, T(n) exists in O(f(n^2)).

    Proof by Induction:
    

### How it Works
To run this algorithm type `py Algo1.py`



## Algorithm 2
### Pseudocode
Run through each city as the starting city and return the index if completes an entire cycle.

  
###  Complexity and Efficiency Class
    Proof by Step Count:
    T(n) = 
    
    Proof by Induction:
    1. 

    2. 

    3. 

    4. 

    5. Conclude
    Therefore, T(n) exists in O(n^2).

### How it Works
To run this algorithm type `py Algo2.py`
Will use the example provided in the Project 1 document. (Should return 4)
